# Threedmodel Repo
# The Threedmodel is a repository to demonstrate various ways of making a three-D model and embedding them to a .Net project using the visual studio.
# In this repository, we used Unity game engine also to make a 2d and 3d game, first we started off using one of the Unity templates to get familiar with the game concepts and 
# structure of the 
# Unity game engine.
# In branch three of this repository, we showed the ways of writing a plain model of a game starting all from scratch. We aim to create new scripts to the main platform of the
# game to add more functionality to the game.
